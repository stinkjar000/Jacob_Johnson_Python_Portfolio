## Python Fundamentals

We looked at different functions in python and were able to convert a patients weight between pounds and kilograms

```python
# Any python interpreter can be used as a calculator:
3 + 5 * 4
```




    23




```python
# Lets save a value to a variable
weight_kg = 60
```


```python
print(weight_kg)
```

    60



```python
# Weight0 = valid
# 0Weight = invalid
# weight and Weight are different
```


```python
# Types of data
# There are three common types of data
# Integer numbers
# floating point numbers
# Stringers
```


```python
# Floating point number
weight_kg = 60.3
```


```python
# String comprised of Letters
patient_name = "John Smith"
```


```python
# String comprised of numbers
patient_id = '001'
```


```python
# Use variables in python

weight_lb = 2.2 * weight_kg

print(weight_lb)
```

    132.66



```python
# Lets add a prefix to our patient id

patient_id = 'inflam_' + patient_id

print(patient_id)
```

    inflam_001



```python
# Lets combine print statements

print(patient_id, 'weight in kilograms:', weight_kg)
```

    inflam_001 weight in kilograms: 60.3



```python
# we can call a function inside another function

print(type(60.3))

print(type(patient_id))
```

    <class 'float'>
    <class 'str'>



```python
# We can also do calculations inside the print function

print('weight in lbs:', 2.2 * weight_kg)
```

    weight in lbs: 132.66



```python
print(weight_kg)
```

    60.3



```python
weight_kg = 65.0
print('weight in kilograms is now:', weight_kg)
```

    weight in kilograms is now: 65.0



```python

```
